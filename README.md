FEX Quick Installation Script on Android Devices 
This script is made to automate the process of installing fex-emu on Android devices.
the original project can be found here @"FEX-source-code"


# WHAT-IS-FEX
FEX allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on an AArch64 host, similar to qemu-user and box86. I
t has native support for a rootfs overlay, so you don't need to chroot, as well as some thunklibs so it can forward things like GL to the host. FEX presents a Linux 5.0 interface to the guest, and supports both AArch64 and x86-64 as hosts. FEX is very much work in progress, so expect things to change.
